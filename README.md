Bell Bank Learning Management Software (first real app)

This application, developed on Python and using several packages, like Tkinter and Pillow, will serve to better help training and teaching staff everywhere
by being a learning management software.

The application's main goal is to help manage training classes by providing tools to create, edit and delete classroom rosters, manage grades and learning
progress with a simple and lightweight database, as well as provide management tools for tracking overall training program success.
