	++ smart idea to add a 'Show Training Class/Hide Training Class'
	   option; this would open a small, separate Scrollbar-based Window

	++ below the text boxes, you should be able to select from a Dropdown

	   generate a list of "To-Do" for that class (Checklists class)

		messagebox.showinfo('button-text', 'pop-up window text')
