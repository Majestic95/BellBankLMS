First, we are going to define the nouns of this program:

- Trainee
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Training date
    - Location
    - Position; title
- Class List; Roster
    - Trainee
- Schedule
- Data
- Database
- Checklist
- Curriculum

Thoughts:
  - Data flow: when thinking about relationships between the nouns, ask yourself:
      ? What data does X function or class need from its relationship with Y function or class
      ? CRUD: Design functions (and class structure) with one simple goal for each unit; create, read, update, or delete
