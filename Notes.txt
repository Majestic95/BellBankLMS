7.17 Ideas for 'Bell Bank LMS'

-- "Creating a Training Class" page

	++ smart idea to add a 'Show Training Class/Hide Training Class'
	   option; this would open a small, separate Scrollbar-based Window
	   that actively logs the trainees you're adding

	++ below the text boxes, you should be able to select from a Dropdown
	   menu the 'class' or 'position' they'll be in and that should
	   generate a list of "To-Do" for that class (Checklists class)

-- Notes on Tkinter

	++ in the .pack() function call, you can use non-integer numbers
	   (decimals like 2.5) in pady, padx (not sure about ipady, ipadx)

	++ relatively easy 'information' button template using this format:
		messagebox.showinfo('button-text', 'pop-up window text')

	++ 


-- TO DO

	- Conversion to .grid() geo manager might be necessary to deal with complex layouts
		? conversion process this week
			? does this process happen locally or on a class-based lvl


	- create SQLite database framework
		- notes below help with creation
		- should database connection be happening in __init__() function?s
